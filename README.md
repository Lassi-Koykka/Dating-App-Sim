## Idea
- An idle game, similiar to "Cookie clicker"
-  The player character is a lonely front-end developer looking for love on a popular dating app.
- The player starts out spamming a "swipe right" button until he learns enough programming to create a bot that swipes right for him. More bots = faster swiping
- 10% chance of getting a match
	- After getting a match ...
- Obstacles and dangers: 
  - Accidentaly swiping right on ads (Cooldown)
  - Running out of swipes (Cooldown timer)
  - Running out of hope meter

## Requirements
- **Good documentation**
- Error handling
- Writing and reading from files (_JSON?_)
- Multiple forms
- Components and event handling
- Menus
- Structs
